    content="I have successfully completed foundational and advanced courses in probability and statistics, building a solid understanding of statistical methods and their applications. My coursework in Fundamentals of Probability provided me with a deep comprehension of probability theory and its role in statistical inference. In Statistics, I developed expertise in hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis, which are essential tools for statistical decision-making. Moving forward, in Advanced Statistics, I gained experience with multivariate regression analysis and experiment analysis, enhancing my ability to handle complex datasets. Additionally, my study of Multivariate Statistics equipped me with knowledge of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), classification, clustering techniques, and the use of distance matrices, all of which are critical for dimensionality reduction and data classification in high-dimensional spaces."
