    headline="Machine Learning Specialization" 
    content="I recently completed a Machine Learning specialization, gaining a solid foundation in key concepts like supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and model evaluation. I worked with algorithms such as linear and logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, applying them to real-world datasets. The course also covered advanced topics like deep learning and regularization, equipping me with the skills to develop, optimize, and evaluate machine learning models effectively."

    headline="Structuring Machine Learning Projects" 
    content="I completed the Structuring Machine Learning Projects course, which focused on applying machine learning techniques to real-world projects. The course covered essential steps in the ML workflow, from data preprocessing and feature selection to model building and evaluation. I gained hands-on experience working with tools like Python and libraries such as scikit-learn, applying algorithms to tasks like regression, classification, and clustering. The course enhanced my ability to implement machine learning models in real projects and reinforced my understanding of the end-to-end process of developing effective ML solutions."
