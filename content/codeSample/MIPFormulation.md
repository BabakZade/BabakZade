    MainBody="This project focuses on developing a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) formulation for solving the assignment problem using Python and the Gurobi optimizer. It starts by defining and solving the assignment problem using Gurobi's built-in optimization tools, which provides an efficient way to explore Gurobi's syntax and features for formulating and solving optimization problems. In addition to the standard MIP solution, a custom branch-and-price algorithm was implemented to explore alternative solution methods. This combination of techniques was designed for training purposes, helping users understand the Gurobi package's syntax and capabilities while providing a hands-on approach to solving complex optimization problems. The repository also includes test sets that demonstrate the practical application of the developed models and algorithms."

    MainBody="I developed a variety of optimization algorithms, including both exact and heuristic approaches, tailored to solve complex problems. The exact algorithms, such as Branch-Price-and-Cut, Dynamic Programming, and the Hungarian algorithm, were designed to provide optimal solutions. Additionally, I created heuristic methods based on dynamic programming and explored metaheuristic techniques like Genetic Algorithms and Local Branching to handle larger, more complex problems. These algorithms were developed as part of research initiatives and have been published in peer-reviewed journals, contributing to advancements in the field of optimization and algorithm design. The codes are stored in a private repository and are available upon request for academic and research purposes. "
