    MainBody="This code implements both univariate and multivariate linear regression models from scratch, using gradient descent as the optimization technique. It includes automatic feature scaling for better training performance and offers a detailed mode for logging and visualizing the training process. The code is designed to train models on input data, calculate predictions, and minimize errors using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the cost function. The univariate model handles single-feature inputs, while the multivariate model supports multiple features. With adjustable learning rates and hyperparameters, this implementation provides a flexible and scalable solution for linear regression tasks."

    MainBody="In this project, I developed a logistic regression model from scratch using Python, focusing on both the mathematical formulation and optimization process. The model is designed to classify binary outcomes by employing gradient descent as the optimization technique. I also implemented feature scaling to ensure faster and more stable convergence during training. By creating a custom dataset, the logistic regression problem was solved from the ground up, offering an in-depth learning experience to understand what happens behind the scenes in logistic regression, including the mathematics and optimization involved in making predictions."

    Subtitle="Developed in Python"
    MainBody="In this project, I developed a neural network from scratch using Python, focusing on constructing the architecture, implementing forward and backward propagation, and optimizing the model using gradient descent. The neural network is built for classification tasks, with multiple layers that incorporate non-linear activation functions, and a Softmax layer for multi-class classification. Throughout the project, I gained a deep understanding of how neurons, weights, biases, and activations interact during training to learn and represent complex patterns within the data. This hands-on implementation not only solidified my knowledge of core concepts like loss functions, weight initialization, and backpropagation but also provided insights into practical challenges such as avoiding overfitting, choosing activation functions, and improving convergence through techniques like learning rate adjustments. The project offered a comprehensive exploration into the mechanics of training deep models and fine-tuning their performance for real-world applications."

    Subtitle="Developed in pyhton"
    MainBody="In this project, I developed a time series forecasting model using the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) method to predict future air passenger numbers. The SARIMA model is particularly suited for handling data with both trend and seasonal components, which is typical in air passenger datasets. The project includes data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values and ensuring stationarity, followed by model selection based on the dataset's characteristics. After fitting the SARIMA model to the air passenger data, I evaluated its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visualized both the modelâ€™s predictions and actual values. This project was designed to gain a practical understanding of time series forecasting and to demonstrate how SARIMA can be effectively applied to real-world datasets."
